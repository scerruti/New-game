1) Move all classes to their own files.
2) Move all images and sounds to a resources folder.
3) Create a class for Thomas, we will copy all of Thomas' functionality to this class.
4) As you build Thomas' functionality you will notice functionality that is common to all game objects.
At that point extract a game object superclass. I've implemented an intersect method and a draw method.
5) Now we can build road and track from game object.
6) We will see that we can extend track into upper and lower track.
7) Moved the landing code into the activity handler
